                    <p>All teams must be back there at <b>15:30</b>. 
                    If you think you are finished and want to meet us before then please text us on

                    </p>
                    <p>Normal pub quiz rules apply, so you are on your honour not to search the Internet for the answers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Find where photos shown on the <a href="index.html">photos</a> page were taken. </p>
                    <p>Take your own
                        photo of the same thing including a member of your own team in the shot.
                        For example, you might
                        recognize this photo as the door of the Tide Mill.</p>
                    <span class="left"><img src="index_files/image003.jpg" alt="White Door" /></span>
                    <p>So take a photo like this one to prove you have been there
                        <span class="right"><img src="index_files/image004.png" alt="White Door Answer" /></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>You can bring your photos back to us or email them with your team number to <a
                            href="mailto:paulthepod@gmail.com">paulthepod@gmail.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>The first team back to Pauline and I with all the photos is the
                        winner. If no team gets all the photos within the time allowed then the team with the most correct
                        answers wins.

                    <p>Get to know your fellow team members and have fun.</p>
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>I will try to maintain a <a href="Results2.htm">score board, during the afternoon but no guarantees on that</a> </p>
        
                    <h2>Answers</h2>
                    <p>After the event I will post a link <b>here</b> to a Google photo album. From there you can click on the info button to see a map of where it was taken.</p>
