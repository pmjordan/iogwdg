                <h1>Instructions</h1>
                <p>Normal pub quiz rules apply, so you are on your honour not to search the internet for the answers.
                </p>
                <p>Find where photos shown on the <a href="index.html">photos</a> page were taken. </p>
                <p>Take your own
                    photo of the same thing including a member of your own team in the shot.
                    For example, you might
                    recognize this photo as the door of the Tide Mill.</p>
                <span class="left"><img src="index_files/image003.jpg" alt="White Door" /></span>
                <p>So take a photo like this one to prove you have been there
                    <span class="right"><img src="index_files/image004.png" alt="White Door Answer" /></span>
                </p>
                <p>You can bring your photos back to us or email them with your team number to <a
                        href="mailto:paulthepod@gmail.com">paulthepod@gmail.com</a>.</p>
                <p>The first team back to Pauline and I with all the photos is the
                    winner. If no team gets all the photos within the time allowed then the team with the most correct
                    answers wins.</p>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>I will try to maintain a <a href="Results2.htm">score board</a> </p>
    
                <h2>Answers</h2>
                <p>After the event I will post a link <b>here</b> to a Google photo album. From there you can click on the info button to see a map of where it was taken.</p>
